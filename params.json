{"name":"Andowe","body":"### About Andowe.\r\nAndowe is a small, simple programming language I am experimenting with to learn more about how programming languages work.  It is based originally on the Kaleidoscope language from the LLVM tutorials.  The lexer, parser, and front end are all written in OCaml, while the back end uses LLVM for code generation.\r\n\r\n### Building\r\nTo build the latest version of Andowe, simply check out the head of this repository.  Then, in your working copy, run\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ make clean\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting binary can be run with\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/andowe\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/andowe path/to/code.and\r\n```\r\n\r\nto run the code in a file on your machine.","tagline":"A simple programming language based on LLVM's Kaleidoscope tutorials","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
