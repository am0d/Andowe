Andowe is a small language that I am implementing.
It is implemented in OCaml, using an LLVM backend for compilation and
JIT interpretation.

Some of the features of the language will be:
    - Support for object-oriented programming
    - Support for functional programming
    - Static duck-typing with type inference
    - Garbage collection
    - Pattern matching
    - Separate module compilation
    - Polymorphic functions

Currently, I am going through the Kaleidoscope tutorial available on http://llvm.net and implementing it, but I will later be extending this to create my own language Andowe.
