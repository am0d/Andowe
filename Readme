Andowe is a small language that I am implementing.
It is implemented in OCaml, using an LLVM backend for compilation and
JIT interpretation.

Some of the features of the language are:
    - Support for object-oriented programming
    - Support for functional programming
    - Static duck-typing with type inference
    - Garbage collection
    - Pattern matching
    - Separate module compilation
    - Significant whitespace (blocks are defined by indentation)
    - Polymorphic functions
